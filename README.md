# Weather App React Project

This is a weather application that allows users to search for a city by name and view the current temperature, weather conditions, wind speed, and past weather data. It also provides the functionality to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit units of measurement. The app utilizes a public weather API (OpenWeatherMap) to retrieve the necessary weather data.

## Features

- Search for weather information of any city.
- View current weather conditions, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and heat index.
- Graphical representation of temperature trends for the previous days.
- Recent searches feature to quickly access previously searched cities.
- Responsive design for seamless usage on different devices.
